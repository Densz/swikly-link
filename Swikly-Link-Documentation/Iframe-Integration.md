In the context of your application or integration, you may have to include Swikly's [Sandbox or Production Checkout](/Swikly-Link-Documentation/Environments) in an Iframe.  
**This is not allowed by default**.
In case you need an Iframe integration, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@swikly.com). Each Iframe integration request is then processed by our compliance team.
